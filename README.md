## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI**: Google's Gemini API
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Data Processing**: Pandas

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- MongoDB instance (local or remote, set the MONGO_URI in your .env)
- Google Gemini API key (for AI-powered content generation)

### Installation

For complete setup instructions, please see the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md).

#### Quick Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakshamChouhan/linkedin-content-ai.git
cd linkedin-content-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your credentials in a `.env` file:  
Create a file named `.env` in the project root (same folder as `app.py`), and add:
```dotenv
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
Replace `your_gemini_api_key` with your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/), and `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017`).  
*Note: Do not wrap your keys in quotation marks.*

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
By default, this opens at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## Architecture

A detailed explanation of the application's architecture, main modules, and their interactions is available in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
