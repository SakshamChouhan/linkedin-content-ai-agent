        "content":"Artisan is one of a bevy of fast-growing startups in the highly watched AI sales development representative (AI SDR) market. It’s probably best known for its “Stop Hiring Humans” marketing campaign that has generated many news articles, social media posts, comments, and a few death threats, says the company. However, when asked if he truly believes that AI will replace people, 23-year-old founder and CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack says, “No, which is ironic, because we did the billboards that said, ‘stop hiring humans’ but that was mostly just for attention.” Read more from Julie Bort on Artisan here: https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/4lpgW0E #TechCrunch #technews #artificialintelligence #startup #founder #AIstartup",

        "content":"We raised our $25M Series A just 6 months after our seed. Here are the four reasons why: 1. The market is moving fast. A lot of new players are entering and we need to ship amazing products fast if we want to win 2. We want to maintain our really strong momentum. A lot of startups lose their momentum and their velocity platesus if they sit in one funding stage for too long. Raising keeps the team excited, opens doors with bigger customers and builds brand awareness 3. We wanted to attract amazing talent (most senior leadership & great engineers don’t want to take a risk on a seed stage company) 4. We know what we need to build, it’s just a matter of executing. And to build our ambitious roadmap, we needed more talented people on the team Every startup has its own pace. For Artisan, it’s moving relentlessly fast because we know we have an opportunity here and we don’t want to miss it For some, building a company bootstrapped is the right path. If you want to maintain full control of your company, choose your own pace and take dividends, don’t raise money. If you want to move extremely fast and build a generational company, raise at a regular cadence And if you want to join us, apply here: artisan.co\/careers Or hire our AI BDR Ava (who works even faster than us 😉) then get in touch: artisan.co\/talk-to-sales",

        "content":"We’ve raised over $35M, crossed $5M ARR, generated billions of organic impressions - and still have zero people on our internal marketing team That’s not because marketing isn’t a priority. If you’ve seen our billboards or AI CEO, you know we take brand awareness very seriously... We’ve just been deliberate about staying lean. While we’ve hired aggressively across product and engineering, marketing is the one function we’ve chosen to scale differently - all campaigns are managed by me and Tina Sang Our marketing approach is to: - Stick to activities which leverage our time as much as possible - Leverage AI and automation as much as possible - Avoid wasting time on bureaucracy - Ruthlessly prioritize with quarterly marketing strategies - Rely on expert freelancers for specific functions like SEO, paid, content, video, animation & much more. We couldn’t achieve what we have without them A bloated internal marketing team drains creativity and slows you down That being said, we're at capacity and we’re ready to finally make our first marketing hire! If you want to help us brainstorm crazy billboard slogans or our next viral campaign, apply here: artisan.co\/careers And if you need a AI BDR to keep your marketing team lean, hire Ava here: artisan.co\/talk-to-sales",

        "content":"After announcing our $25M Series A last week, I'm excited to share that we are launching V3 of Artisan This release brings us closer to what outbound should be: one consolidated AI-native platform that’s intent-driven and actually effective Most teams today juggle 5+ tools just to run basic outreach. It’s clunky and outdated. Our AI BDR Ava watches the market, identifies intent signals, and acts in real time Here’s what’s new in V3: Data miner - Ava scrapes 100s of sources (firmographic, technographic, intent) to pull rich lead data Personalization waterfall - Ava dynamically identifies the best personalization on a lead level Watchtower campaigns - Ava monitors intent signals across the internet and launches outreach the moment a lead shows buying intent (this is being rolled out with more and more triggers over the next few months) Outbound is evolving. And we’re building the system that leads the shift Learn more about Ava: artisan.co\/talk-to-sales While this is exciting for us, I'm beyond excited to share what V4 looks like - there's truly nothing like it on the market. It's already in the works and will be launching in Q3",
